# lnk306_nonisolated_psu
WARNING! This is an non-isolated power supply, so even the DC output will have a dangerous mains potential.
Do not use it unless you know the difference between isolated or non-isolated power supply.

My goal was to obtain a DC-DC supply with a very wide operating voltage range. 
On tests with 5v output, this power supply provides enough voltage for esp32 starting from 20v input voltage (DC)
